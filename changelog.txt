BREXX CMS Change LOG
====================
0.9.11- 4 Feb 2021
F0043 - Maths fixes (Integer to Double promotion) - MULT, ADD, SUBT
        FORMAT fix (log10 Rounding error)
        Integer detecting fix, small >1 (e.g. 0.0000n) is not an integer
        SAY Always used FORMAT to format numbers (incl. integers)
        Equals - use an epsilon
        MATHS_ EXEC TESTS
F0042 - FORMAT() Complete rewrite!
F0040 - TRUNC() fix - replaced string to numeric parser with one that adds
        an epsilon to ensure a round up with a number with a 5 as the least
        significant digit. Also looks at the digit after the max significant
        digits to decide rounding.
F0039 - POS() fix - zero length needle should return 0
        Fixed check if a real is an int - significant digits not worked out right
F0038 - LASTPOS() fix
F0037 - X2D fixes
